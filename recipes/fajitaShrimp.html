    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Love the ease of a sheet pan? Your next dinner should be these sheet pan steak and shrimp fajitas. Slice up the vegetables and give them a slight head start in the oven, so everything will be cooked at the same time. Serve with Mexican rice or lime-cilantro rice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Mexican oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound sirloin steak, sliced 1/4-inch thick across the grain</li>
        <li>16 medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>1 lime, halved</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh cilantro sprigs</li>
        <li>8 (8-inch) flour tortillas</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper or aluminum foil.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Combine chili powder, smoked paprika, oregano, salt, cumin, garlic powder, and cayenne in a small bowl.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In a large bowl, combine green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and onion with 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil and 1/2 of dry seasoning mixture. Toss until evenly coated with seasoning mixture and spread out in a single layer on one of the prepared pans.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Meanwhile, in the same large bowl, toss steak and shrimp with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil; add remaining seasoning and toss again. Place steak on one side of second prepared pan, with shrimp on the other side of pan.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Place steak and shrimp on a rack below vegetables and roast both pans for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, swap rack positions of the pans, bringing the lower pan up, and placing the other pan on the rack below. Continue roasting until shrimp is pink and tightly curled, steak is cooked to medium, and vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes more. An instant read thermometer inserted in center of steak should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) . If steak or vegetables require more time, remove shrimp to a plate and keep warm, while other ingredients continue cooking. Squeeze juice of half a lime over contents of each sheet pan.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>To serve: Place a few steak strips, onion and pepper strips, 2 shrimp, and some cilantro on each tortilla. Roll up tortillas and contents jelly-roll fashion, and enjoy!</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
